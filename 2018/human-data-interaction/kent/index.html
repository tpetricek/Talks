with more applied work on programming tools for data science that I've been doing recently.</p>

<p><em>The essence of programming process</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more immediate applied part of the research is making it easier to use data - and I see making
facts more accessible and trustworthy as a way in which a computer scientist can fight with
dangerous trends in the society today.</p>
<p>The way data scientists program is very interesting from the programming language perspective,
because it breaks some of the usual assumptions about programming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The data science I have in mind is often quite simple and it is done for example by journalists.
For example, this Guardian article is using data to illustrate inequality in the world. Do
we trust the data? Yes, we do, because we are academics and we trust The Guardian!</p>
<p>But what if we wanted to verify this? That is quite hard - The Guardian says the source is
the WorldBank, but how do we check that? The problem is that there is no source code!</p>

<p>If you're doing data science, you can turn to the dark side and use spreadsheets. They are
very easy to use, but you can only deal with small tabular data and the results are not
reproducible.</p>

unlimited power, but it requires expert skills.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The interesting question for a programming language person is - what makes spreadsheets so
successful? And more importantly, how can programming tools learn from spreadsheets?
My key point is that we need to think about the process of programming. In spreadsheets,
you work with data directly, which is quite different from how most programming systems work.</p>

<p>To illustrate, I'll show you how to get the inequality data from the WorldBank using

<p>I wrote a PLDI paper about the theory behind this, which won a best paper award, but
let's focus on the interactions - how I actually write the code.</p>

<p><em><span class="circ"><span>2</span></span> Program against data, not abstract symbols</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you can see in the demo, programming with data is a very interactive process.
You write some code using autocomplete, run it, look at the results, then modify
your code. This interactivity is super important. Also, you typically work with
real or sample data directly. Your variables actually have values that you could
use to help the programmer.</p>

<h1>Research vision</h1>
<p><em>Programming as human data interaction</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My key research idea is that we need to focus on programming and see it as an interactive
process of working with data - I'll focus on data, but the same applies to interactive
theorem proving where you interact with your theorems.</p>

<p><em><i class="fa fa-user"></i> <em>Human centric perspective</em></em></p>
<p><em><i class="fa fa-wrench"></i> <em>Enables new tools and methods</em></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To understand programming properly, we need to find some small tractable model of it.
In functional programming, we use lambda calculus to understand what is going on, so we
need a similar essence of programming interactions. Then we can analyze it formally,
use it to understand the human side of programming and use it as a basis for new
tools and verification methods - and find new ways of working with data.</p>

<h2>Formal mathematical perspective</h2>

<p><em><span class="circ"><span>3</span></span> Properties of program construction</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What can we say about interactions formally? There are standard ideas like type safety
which gain a new meaning - because they might depend on data. We can also track provenance
throughout the interaction. For example, if you make "copy and paste" a primitive, you can
track provenance in ways that were previously impossible. I'm very interested in this,
because my PhD research on coeffects can help with this. Finally, there are also new properties
that are related to how programs can be constructed interactively.</p>

<h2>Human centric perspective</h2>
<p><em><span class="circ"><span>1</span></span> Cognitive cost of interactions</em></p>
<p><em><span class="circ"><span>2</span></span> Programming by direct manipulation</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the human centric perspective, we can look at cognitive cost of individual interactions.
For example, selecting an option from an autocomplete - as you can do in F# Data - is easier
than if you have to type a column name from scratch. Can we solve more complex problems
with such simpler modes of interaction?</p>
<p>Second, we can also find ways to do some of programming not by writing code, but by
manipulating with the data directly like in spreadsheets.</p>

<p>To summarize, I think a lot of the foundational programming language work has been
focusing on languages and programs - and I want to extend that to cover programming
as an interactive process. The way to do this is to think about the essence - or a
minimal calculus - which then allows us to build new tools for easy trustworthy
data science - and I think applications like data journalism make this an important

work on philosophy and history of programming and I got invited to submit a paper to an
ACM HOPL conference, so that's my third. I have ideas about coeffects too, but I only wanted

<p>How do these two styles compare? In the object-oriented style, you will have one
class per shape. Operations like rendering will be written as abstract methods.
This means that it is easy to add new cases - you just define a new class, but
it is harder to add new methods, because you need to modify all classes.</p>
<p>In functional style, you define one case per shape and operations will be just functions
that use pattern matching to handle all cases. This means that it is easy to add new
operations, but if you add a new case, you need to modify all operations.</p>
<p>This is why it is nice to know both object oriented and functional programming!
An interesting problem is if you wanted to add both cases and operations - I don't
have the time for this, but if you are interested, search for "the expression problem"
and you'll see there are some interesting solutions to this!</p>

<p>What should you remember from this lecture? Domain specific languages are useful if you
have repeated problem with small variations. This includes things like financial and insurance
contracts, but also queries for reports and tests. Domain specific languages make this
easier, because you define a model with a nice syntax and you can then use the domain
specific language to easily solve new instances of the problem.</p>
